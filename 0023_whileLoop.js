// While Loop

// For loop is used when number of itrations are certain, and while loop is used when number of itration are not certain or finite.

// Run something while something else is true.
// lets say you are playing the retro snake game, where you have to make the snake eat all the food that apears inside the play area, without getting the snake smashed in the wall, if the snake hits the wall, gave over.
// now its not certain after how many moves the snake might hit the wall, it can be 4 it can be 100.



// introducing while loop.

// let dice = Math.random() * 6
// console.log(dice);

// Math.random() would give us a floating point number between 0 and 1 excluding 1, like 0.2 or 0.9998.
// Math.random() * 6 would give us a floating point number between 0 to 6 excluding 6. like 0.66 , 1.8 ,2.7 ,3.453 , 4.90, 5.9987
// Math.trunc() would remove the digits after decimal point and would provide us with a whole number, like 0,1,2,3,4,5 BUT.....
// A normal dice doesn't have a Zero lable, it starts from 1 and goes up to 6, not 5
// to achive this will add 1 to the result we got.
// this will result in a random integer generation between 1 and 6, including both 1 and 6. Dice

let dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 6 ) +1; 
// console.log(dice);
while(dice !== 6){
    console.log(`You rolled a ${dice}`);
    dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 6 ) +1;
}
console.log('=============dice end============');


// INTVQ  -- different ways for fact_string.
// lets illustrate this with a Prime factorization program.
// Prime factorization of any number means to represent that number as a product of prime numbers.
